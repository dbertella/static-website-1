Basic files to start an html and css + react project

Gulp file already set with connect to run th webserver, sass and autoprefixer to give superpower to your css.
Gulp will, of course, handle react files as well.
All you need to start coding is to run npm install in the project root and then run gulp in the terminal.

Hope this can speed up your job.
